# Dev Log - Centrifix
### 6/27/2025
Perhaps this is unconventional? Oh well. Today I started the whimsical journey of creating my web app. I set up a repo, cloned it and linked it to VSCode, installed node.js and set up a node server in /server and a react app in /client. I confirmed both were working by running "node index.js" in /server and "npm start" in /client to display the text:
"Todo App
API is runningðŸš€"

Oh, and I also added a package.json allowing me to run "npm run dev" in the root folder to concurrently start the front and back ends.

I'm feeling pretty good about all of this! It's exciting to see the skills I've developed over the past years starting to come together.
