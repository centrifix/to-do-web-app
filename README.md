# to-do-web-app
A project I started to demonstrate fundamental front-end and back-end skills. Project will use React.js, Node.js/Express and more.
## Purpose
As previously stated, the purpose of this project is to provide an example of skills usable in the field of software development, specifically **Full-Stack Development**. Because this is a personal project - as opposed to in contract with an official org. - I will take the liberty of having fun! For example, this README will include a section dedicated to the appreciation of my cats (see below).
